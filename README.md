cmdb for crops metaDB!
Crops Metabolomics Database is a rsepository of plant secondary metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry data for crops, including rice, corn, soy bean, and wheat among others.
We compared and analyzed some public databases (mainly from KEGG, MetaCyc, PlantCyc) and integrated their data. There are currently 2844 plant secondary metabolites in our database. 
Their chemical formula, molecular weight, structure, involved biological processes, and links to outside resources are available on the website, where researchers can search, visualize, and download metabolomics data. 
MS/MS data are also available on many of the metabolites. In addition to the MS/MS data from our own studies, some of the metabolites also have MS/MS data from other public databases such as MassBank and METLIN. 
We are in the process of developing our own searching and visualizing tools. 
Users can search by compound chemical information (name, molecular weight), by experiment source, or by peaks and by spectrum of MS/MS data.
Users can also browse their own spectra on our visualizing tool and analyze them. In the future, we will provide an interface for users to submit their metabolomics data.
